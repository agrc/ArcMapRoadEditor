This C#.net project uses ESRI's ArcObjects (ArcMap 10.7.x) to assist in UGRC's monthly SGID Road update process. 

This project contains an ArcMap toolbar with 4 tools. 

This project also requires the .NET setup project (VS Installer package) to create the installation files (.msi). You can access the setup solution on the google drive.
